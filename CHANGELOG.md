# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project currently
tracks releases under the 2.1.x series.

## [2.1.7] - 2025-10-29
### Removed
- Purged IDE metadata, historical log outputs, unused static assets, and legacy diagnostic scripts
  that were no longer referenced by the application.
### Changed
- Updated ignore rules and documentation so generated EAS artifacts and runtime logs remain outside
  version control while keeping the static directory available for downloads.

## [2.1.6] - 2025-10-28
### Changed
- Aligned build metadata across environment defaults, the diagnostics endpoints, and the
  site chrome so `/health`, `/version`, and the footer display the same system version.
- Refreshed the README to highlight core features, deployment steps, and configuration
  guidance.

## [2.1.5] - 2025-10-27
### Added
- Added database-backed administrator authentication with PBKDF2 hashed passwords,
  login/logout routes, session persistence, CLI bootstrap helpers, and audit logging.
- Expanded the admin console with a user management tab, dedicated login page, and APIs
  for creating, updating, or disabling accounts.
- Introduced `.env.example` alongside README instructions covering environment setup and
  administrator onboarding.
- Implemented the EAS broadcaster pipeline that generates SAME headers, synthesizes WAV
  audio, optionally toggles GPIO relays, stores artifacts on disk, and exposes them
  through the admin interface.
- Published `/admin/eas_messages` for browsing generated transmissions and downloading
  stored assets.
### Changed
- Switched administrator password handling to Werkzeug's PBKDF2 helpers while migrating
  legacy salted SHA-256 hashes on first use.
- Extended the database seed script to provision `admin_users`, `eas_messages`, and
  `location_settings` tables together with supporting indexes.

## [2.1.4] - 2025-10-26
### Added
- Persisted configurable location settings with admin APIs and UI controls for managing
  timezone, SAME/UGC codes, default LED lines, and map defaults.
- Delivered a manual NOAA alert import workflow with backend validation, a reusable CLI
  helper, and detailed admin console feedback on imported records.
- Enabled editing and deletion of stored alerts from the admin console, including audit
  logging of changes.
- Broadened boundary metadata with new hydrography groupings and preset labels for water
  features and infrastructure overlays.
### Changed
- Hardened manual import queries to enforce supported NOAA parameters and improved error
  handling for administrative workflows.
- Updated Docker Compose defaults and boundary ingestion utilities to better support
  mixed geometry types.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-25
### Added
- Established the NOAA CAP alert monitoring stack with Flask, PostGIS persistence,
  automatic polling, and spatial intersection tracking.
- Delivered the interactive Bootstrap-powered dashboard with alert history, statistics,
  health monitoring, and boundary management tools.
- Integrated optional LED sign controls with configurable presets, message scheduling,
  and hardware diagnostics.
- Added containerized deployment assets (Dockerfile, docker-compose) and operational
  scripts for managing services.
