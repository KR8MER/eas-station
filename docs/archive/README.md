# Documentation Archive

Historical reference materials, bug reports, and security analyses that are no longer part of the active documentation set. Files are organized by year to preserve context while keeping the project root clean.

## Structure

- `2025/` – Investigations, release notes, and security reports created during the 2025 development cycle.

> These files are retained for institutional knowledge only. They are not part of the current support workflow and should not be edited unless additional historical annotations are required.
