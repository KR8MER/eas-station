# Master Implementation Roadmap

This master checklist captures the remaining high-impact efforts required to transform the laboratory-grade EAS Console into a software-based, drop-in replacement for commercial encoder/decoder hardware. Each theme links to the current code locations and spells out an actionable plan so contributors can pick up the work quickly. The platform is still experimental and must not yet be relied upon in place of FCC-certified equipment, but every task below moves us closer to that goal.

## Drop-In Replacement Requirements
To match the expectations of purpose-built EAS appliances, the project must deliver:

1. **Reliable Baseband Capture** – Continuous ingest from SDR and line-level sources with synchronized metering and diagnostics.
2. **Deterministic Audio Playout** – A queued audio engine that guarantees SAME headers, attention tones, and voice are rendered in the correct order and level every time.
3. **Hardware Control & Redundancy** – GPIO, relay, and network integrations with watchdog timers and audit trails that rival broadcast controllers.
4. **Security & Access Assurance** – Role-based access, multi-factor authentication, and tamper-evident logging.
5. **Resilient Operations** – Backup, failover, and health monitoring to survive outages without operator intervention.
6. **Turnkey Deployment** – Guided setup, automated configuration, and validation tooling for predictable installations on commodity hardware.
7. **Regulatory Compliance Support** – Reporting, analytics, and verification that prove the system is performing required weekly/monthly tasks.
8. **Unified Documentation** – Repository and web UI content that keeps operators aligned on safety boundaries and configuration changes.
9. **Certification Readiness** – Repeatable test harnesses, evidence collection, and configuration baselines that support an FCC Part 11 certification bid for the Raspberry Pi-based build.
10. **Release Governance & Audit Trails** – Enforce version numbering, changelog discipline, and upgrade/backup automation so deployments remain traceable.

Each roadmap item below references the requirement(s) it unlocks so contributors can tie deliverables directly to hardware parity.

## 11. 🚨 Highcharts Removal & Chart.js Migration (CRITICAL - BLOCKS COMMERCIAL RELEASE)
- **Goal**: Replace Highcharts with permissively-licensed charting library to enable commercial distribution.
- **Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKER** - Current implementation uses Highcharts which requires commercial license for any commercial use.
- **Legal Risk**: ❌ **CANNOT DISTRIBUTE COMMERCIALLY** until Highcharts is removed.
- **Acknowledgment**: ✅ **DOCUMENTED AND ACKNOWLEDGED** - See `LICENSE_COMPLIANCE_CRITICAL.md` for full details.
- **Commitment**: NO commercial releases will use Highcharts. All commercial distributions will use Chart.js or another permissively-licensed alternative.
- **Plan**:
  1. **Audit Highcharts Usage** ✅ COMPLETE
     - Identified all Highcharts dependencies in `templates/stats/_scripts.html` (12+ chart types, ~1,543 lines)
     - Identified alert delivery charts in `static/js/charts/alert_delivery.js` (~113 lines)
     - Documented licensing issue in `LICENSE_COMPLIANCE_CRITICAL.md`
  2. **Design Chart.js Migration Strategy**
     - Create abstraction layer for charting API to enable gradual migration
     - Map each Highcharts chart type to Chart.js equivalent (pie → doughnut, column → bar, etc.)
     - Design unified chart configuration schema that works across both libraries during transition
     - Document Chart.js plugin requirements (chartjs-plugin-datalabels, chartjs-adapter-date-fns, etc.)
  3. **Implement Statistics Dashboard Migration**
     - Replace pie charts (alert types, status breakdown, boundary types) with Chart.js
     - Replace column/bar charts (severity, day-of-week, monthly, yearly trends) with Chart.js
     - Replace heatmap chart (temporal activity) with Chart.js matrix plugin
     - Replace gauge chart (reliability) with Chart.js radial gauge
     - Replace spline/area charts (recent activity, forecast) with Chart.js line charts
     - Replace stock chart (multi-timeline comparison) with Chart.js time-series
     - Replace xrange chart (lifecycle timeline) with Chart.js bar chart with time axis
     - Implement drilldown functionality using Chart.js click handlers
  4. **Implement Alert Delivery Charts Migration**
     - Replace stacked column charts in `static/js/charts/alert_delivery.js`
     - Migrate tooltip formatters and data processing logic
     - Ensure color scheme consistency with existing dashboard
  5. **Testing & Validation**
     - Create comprehensive test suite for all chart types
     - Verify data accuracy matches original Highcharts implementation
     - Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
     - Validate responsive behavior and mobile rendering
     - Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ alerts)
  6. **Remove Highcharts Dependencies**
     - Delete Highcharts CDN loader from `templates/stats/_scripts.html`
     - Remove all Highcharts API calls and configurations
     - Update dependency attribution in `docs/reference/dependency_attribution.md`
     - Final license compliance audit to verify no Highcharts remnants
  7. **Documentation Updates**
     - Update `LICENSE_COMPLIANCE_CRITICAL.md` status to RESOLVED
     - Document Chart.js customization in `docs/frontend/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`
     - Add charting best practices guide for future contributors
     - Update help documentation with new chart interaction patterns

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks for complete migration
**Priority**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Must complete before any commercial distribution
**Risk**: HIGH - Statistics dashboard is core feature, migration must maintain feature parity
**License Note**: Chart.js (MIT) and all required plugins are permissively licensed and safe for commercial use.

## Recommended Future Enhancements
- Capture RBDS metadata surfaced by the new demodulator in a web dashboard widget and expose it via the analytics API for downstream signage.
- Add a standby node bootstrap script that replays the latest backup, re-seeds SSL credentials, and validates Icecast connectivity before promoting the node.
- Implement automated documentation synchronization tool that scans code to update roadmap completion status.
- Create interactive roadmap web UI at `/roadmap` with live progress tracking and PR linking.
- Build feature flag system to allow gradual rollout of new UI components (e.g., toggle between old/new alerts page).
