# Portainer Deployment Guides

Quick references for installing and maintaining EAS Station through Portainer. These documents complement the main [Portainer Deployment Guide](../../guides/PORTAINER_DEPLOYMENT) by providing focused workflows and deep dives.

## Documents

- `PORTAINER_QUICK_START.md` – Five-minute stack deployment checklist
- `PORTAINER_DATABASE_SETUP.md` – External database configuration steps
- `PORTAINER_NETWORK_SETUP.md` – Network and reverse-proxy considerations

> Use these alongside the primary deployment guide to give operators actionable runbooks without cluttering the project root.
