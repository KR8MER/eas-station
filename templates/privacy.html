                            This project is in active development and is intended for lab evaluation only. Review these practices
                            before deploying any optional telemetry or uploading real-world data.

                        <p>EAS Station runs entirely under your control. The maintainers do not operate hosted services, collect
                           analytics, or process personal data from your deployments. Any data the software stores resides within
                           the infrastructure you provision.</p>
                    </section>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">2. Local Data Storage</h2>
                        <p>The application may store configuration details, receiver metadata, CAP alert content, generated audio,
                           and system logs in your database and file system. These records are necessary for testing workflows but
                           must not be treated as authoritative emergency information. Remove sample data before repurposing a
                           system and secure any backups you create.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">3. Optional Integrations</h2>
                        <p>If you enable third-party services (such as Azure Speech or SMTP relays) their respective privacy
                           policies apply. Configure credentials using environment variables and avoid transmitting sensitive or
                           personally identifiable information through these integrations.</p>

                        <p>Because EAS Station is experimental, populate it only with non-production test data. Do not ingest live
                           IPAWS traffic, dispatch center logs, or other mission critical sources. The maintainers do not accept
                           responsibility for safeguarding any datasets you choose to import.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Restrict access to the application behind VPNs or private networks.</li>
                            <li>Rotate credentials regularly and store secrets outside of source control.</li>
                            <li>Review dependency advisories and apply updates before exposing the system to additional testers.</li>
                            <li>Disconnect experimental builds from broadcast chains, transmitter controls, or other live systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">6. No Data Warranty</h2>
                        <p>The maintainers disclaim all responsibility for data loss, corruption, or disclosure arising from use of
                           the software. You are solely responsible for implementing appropriate backups and safeguards.</p>

                        <p>Submit privacy-related questions through the project's GitHub issues. Do not send sensitive personal
                           data or emergency requests through that channel.</p>
