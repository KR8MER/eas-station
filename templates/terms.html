                            <strong>Critical Safety Notice:</strong> EAS Station is experimental software. It must not be used for
                            life-safety, mission-critical, or FCC-mandated alerting. Commercially certified EAS equipment remains
                            the only acceptable solution for regulatory compliance.

                        <p>EAS Station is an open-source development project currently in a pre-production, experimental phase.
                           The codebase was compared against open-source utilities such as multimon-ng for validation purposes, but
                           all other content—including generated alerts, workflows, and documentation—is original and community
                           authored. The software is provided strictly for research, testing, and educational exploration.</p>
                        <p>By accessing the application or source code you acknowledge that it is <strong>not</strong> a replacement
                           for FCC-certified Emergency Alert System hardware or services and must not be relied upon for life or
                           property protection.</p>

                        <p>The platform is <em>not</em> ready for production use. No representations or warranties are made about
                           the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the system. All outputs—including audio files, logs, and
                           dashboards—may contain defects or omissions. You assume all risk for evaluating the software in lab or

                           regulatory actions that may arise from use or misuse of EAS Station. No emergency responses, broadcast

                            <li>Do not connect EAS Station directly to transmitter plants, IPAWS live interfaces, or any life-safety
                                infrastructure.</li>
                            <li>Retain attribution to the project and respect the licenses of any incorporated open-source
