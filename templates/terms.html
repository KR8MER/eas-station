                            <strong>Critical Safety Notice:</strong> EAS Station is experimental software. It must not be used for
                            life-safety, mission-critical, or FCC-mandated alerting. Commercially certified EAS equipment remains
                            the only acceptable solution for regulatory compliance.

                        <p>EAS Station is an open-source development project currently in a pre-production, experimental phase.
                           The codebase was compared against open-source utilities such as multimon-ng for validation purposes,
                           but all other content—including generated alerts, workflows, and documentation—is original and
                           community authored. The software is provided strictly for research, testing, and educational
                           exploration. It is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for FCC-certified Emergency Alert System
                           hardware or services and must not be relied upon for life or property protection.</p>

                        <p>The platform is <em>not</em> ready for production use. No representations or warranties are made about
                           the accuracy, completeness, reliability, availability, or timeliness of the system. All outputs—
                           including audio files, logs, dashboards, and reports—may contain defects or omissions. The project is
                           provided on an “AS IS” basis without warranties of any kind, and you assume all risk for evaluating

                           broadcast activations, or public warning decisions should be based on this project. You agree to indemnify,
                           defend, and hold harmless the project authors, maintainers, and contributors from claims arising out of your
                           deployment, configuration, redistribution, or failure to control access to the project.</p>

                           workflows still function before relying on any update for lab exercises.</p>
